        <p class="lead">To live a low-impact life together, rewild, grow some veg and enjoy nature.</p>
        <p>Update: We're on our way! Check <a href="#updates">below</a> for regular updates, but here's the latest in brief:<p>

        <p>We are looking for people to join us in or near Bristol, with the intention to form a bond and develop friendships, and either find a large<sup>*</sup> place to rent together for a year or so June/July 2022; or join an existing cohousing/intentional community group. We hope to find a group of people, become a bit closer to each other, and then take the next step to purchase land/etc after we've got a good grounding in friendship and good communication :)</p> 

        <p>If this sort of timeline meets your needs and you like our vision below, then please get in touch and we'll have a chat on the phone or meet in person.</p>

        <p class="small"><sup>*</sup> what do we mean by “large space”? We value our privacy as well as community so we wish to live together but not be on top of each other!</p>

        <p>The overview/longer view...</p>
        <p>We are three people inspired by nature, community, friendship and wellbeing, looking to start a co-housing project with the values of permaculture, living close to nature, open and honest community, and joyful living. We are at very early stages, we are looking for other people who want to join us in this adventure and be part of shaping the plan. What we end up creating will depend on who else joins us! These are some of the things we aspire to creating:</p>

            <p class="card-text text-left">
              We've been volunteering a few days at <a href="https://www.plotgatecommunityfarm.org">Plotgate Community Farm</a>, in Somerset!
              Dan and Amy, the wonderful <a href="https://landworkersalliance.org.uk/traineeship/">Land Workers Alliance-assisted trainees</a> and other volunteers here
              have made us feel very welcome and passed on a lot of patient knowledge to us.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text text-left">
              Plotgate is an amazing place - a largely hand-worked farm, using
              <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/guardian-masterclass-blog/2019/nov/15/what-is-the-no-dig-method-charles-dowding-demystifies">no-dig methods</a>
              to provide around 60-80 weekly veg boxes to the local area.
              The soil is clay, but over the course of their careful land management, it is becoming richer and more productive annually.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text text-left">
              We've been stuck in using human-powered tools &mdash;
              some traditional, and some amazing things formed from Dan's mind and experience &mdash;
              to turn 30m beds from productive yet vibrantly wildflower-laden over to their next rotation; weed-free, pesticide/herbicide-free;
              producing a different crop, following the no-dig methodology.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text text-left">
              We don't think we want to be operating something at this scale for ourselves, our hopes for grow-your-own will largely be consumed within our group, we think;
              but it is so inspiring to see community supported agriculture, teeming with wildlife, regenerating soil from "ground-zero" as it were!
            </p>
            <p class="card-text text-left">
              If you're in the area, Dan and Amy and the team welcome extra hands (particularly if you know how to work a hoe!),
              the days for which are Monday, Wednesday and Friday - go earn your veg!

            <p class="card-text text-left">
              With the intention to live in the South West, we're leaving London ASAP; this is the first step on our journey.
              We hope this will make it easier to find and become life-long friends with other folk in the area who share our dream.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text text-left">
              By June 2022, we will all (three) have moved to Somerset; Máire is taking the lead and will start a new job in Bristol in 2 months (May), Steve is following in November this year, and Andy in June 2022.
              We're all planning to keep our 'cognitive' work in some form or another for a long time yet, and hoping the remote-work precedent that Covid has cemented will help there &mdash; so we want to establish ourselves in the area before leaping into a totally new way of life!
            </p>
            <p class="card-text text-left lead">
              The next step...
            </p>
            <p class="card-text text-left">
              By June 2022, our intention is to have found ourselves in one of two (..three?) scenarios:
              <ul>
                <li class="text-left">...to have grown our group a little bit from 3 to 4, 5, 6..? and to rent a good-sized property for maybe a year, to settle our relationships with each other and create trust and assurance that we can go forward to the next step</li>
                <li class="text-left">...or for the 3 of us to find a co-housing/intentional community project which has space for us to join.</li>
                <li class="text-left">...but we're open to other paths!</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="card-text text-left">
              If this sort of timescale appeals to you - and the process of getting to know each other (we really don't want to rush it!) then please get in touch with us <a href="mailto:people@alovelyplan.org"> by email</a>.
